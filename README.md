This repository contains my implementation of
“MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js” (Udemy / Brad Traversy).

The project is a complete social network application with authentication, profiles, posts, likes and comments.

⚠️ Note: The course uses Heroku for deployment,
but Heroku’s hosting is no longer available (free tier removed).
Deployment instructions here use Render / Railway / Vercel instead.

👤 User profiles (create, edit, experience, education)
